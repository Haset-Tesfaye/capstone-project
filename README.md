🎬 **Movie Zone**
Welcome to the Movie Website project! This project was developed as part of the GDG Beginners Track by a team of 5 web developers. The website provides a simple and interactive platform to browse movies using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also integrates an API to fetch movie data dynamically.

🖥 **Project Overview**
This Movie Website allows users to view details about various movies including titles, posters, release dates, and more. The data is fetched from a movie API, and the website displays it in an attractive and easy-to-navigate layout.
